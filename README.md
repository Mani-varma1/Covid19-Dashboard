# Covid19-Dashboard
First ever Dashboard with interactive functions


A really basic dashboard that show cases deaths in vacinated population based on ages. Not asthetically amazing due to being new to coding.
Thanks to fabrizio smeraldi for teaching how to code.


The month filter still not functional
